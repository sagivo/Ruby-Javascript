about
-
We all love ruby. The main reason we love ruby is that it's so easy to write code at.
This project aims to bring the joy of Ruby into Javascript language. How? <br>
Imagin doing that:<br>
`var msg = "hellow world";`<br>
`msg.titlize`
> "Hello World"` 

`msg.reverse`
>"dlrow wolleh"`

Now imaging that:<br>
`1..day.fromNow`
> return a date object contains the next day

`3.5.hours.ago`
> return a date object of 3.5 hours ago

- No more extra `()` 
- Clean and simple
- Isn't it cool?<br>

Installing
-
- Include jQuery in your project first: <br>
`<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>`

- in order to install just download the `rjs.js` file (or the minified version) and add it to your file:
`<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/rjs.js"></script>`

- make sure you add this file <b>before</b> calling to any of it's methodes. 

Methodes
-
###extendObject
In order to add your own methode you can call `extendObject(obj, funcName, func, attr)`. This function gets sevral params:

- `obj` - The class you wish to extends (`Number`/ `String`...)
- `funcName` - The name of your new function.
- `attr` - (optional) //TODO add some explanation 

For example:<br>
`extendObject(String, 'sayHello',function(){ return "Hello " + this + "!"; });`

After you define this new methode you can call it from anywhare in your code:<br>
`"John".sayHello`
>"Hello John!"`

###aliasFunc
You can also define an alias to your methodes using `aliasFunc(obj, func, alias)`:

- `obj` - The class you wish to use (`Number`/ `String`...)
- `func` - The existing function you wish to alias.
- `alias` - The alias you want.

For example you can do something like that `aliasFunc(String, 'sayHello', 'greeting')` and then:<br>
`"John".greeting`

>"Hello John"`
